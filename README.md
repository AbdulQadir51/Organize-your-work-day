## An app developed for people who lead busy lives enables them to plan their daily activities and manage their time efficiently.


**This daily planner can be used to create a schedule**
As soon as you open the planner, you can see the current day displayed at the **top of the calendar.**
The time blocks for standard business hours can be found below as you scroll down
You can see a **color-coded indicator** of whether each time block is in the past, present, or future when viewing those time blocks for that day.
Upon clicking into a block of time, you can enter an event.
The text of that event for that time block is then saved in the local storage after you click the save button on that time block

**Refreshing the page will bring up the saved events**
